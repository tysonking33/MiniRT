Typical FOV Values
Standard Values:

90 degrees: Commonly used for a realistic perspective, similar to human vision or typical camera lenses.
60 degrees: Often used for a more zoomed-in effect, making objects appear larger and closer.
45 degrees: Can give a more "telephoto" effect, making objects appear even closer and more magnified.
Wide Angle:

120 to 180 degrees: This is considered a very wide-angle view. Itâ€™s often used for fisheye lenses or when you want to capture a very broad view of the scene.

If the lighting model results in (1.0,0.5,0.3), this corresponds to an RGB color with strong red, moderate green, and little blue, producing a reddish-orange color.



Role of n (Shininess Factor):
Higher values of n: Create smaller, sharper specular highlights, giving the appearance of a smooth or glossy surface. For example, a highly polished surface like metal or glass would have a high shininess factor
Lower values of n: Produce larger, softer specular highlights, making the surface look rougher or more matte. For instance, a rough surface like wood or unpolished stone would have a low shininess factor (e.g., 

n is the shininess factor.
Typical Values for n:
Glossy surfaces (like polished metal): 
n=100 to n=200.
Semi-glossy surfaces (like plastic): 
n=20 to n=50.
Matte surfaces (like rough stone or fabric): 
n=1 to n=10.



ka : Controls how much ambient light is reflected.
kd : Controls how much diffuse light is scattered from direct light sources.
ks : Controls how much light is reflected in a specular (mirror-like) manner.
